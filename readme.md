## DESCRIPTION
Taxidermy is a submod for Trapper+ and will not function unless you have Trapper+ installed
and activated.

Taxidermy adds a new workstation for the Trapper: the Taxidermy Studio, which can be used to 
mount beautiful life-size displays of animals and wall trophies, among other things. Taxidermy 
was originally part of Trapping+ but was moved into a submod per request of some of the testers 
that preferred to have the stuffed animals as an optional item. Please note that neither me nor 
this mod mean to support hunting and the displaying of dead animals in any way and just aim to 
to reproduce real and historical techniques.

## CONTENTS

# MOUNTED ANIMALS & TROPHIES
Most animals can now be mounted by the trapper in beautiful, life-sized displays with a
default pose. The pose is different for every animal and can be seen on the picture when
in the crafting menu. Additionally there are four new wall-mounted trophies.
